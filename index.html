    <h2>About</h2>
    My name is Yusein Kerdakov, I am 18-years old and I am from Kostandovo, Pazardzhik, Bulgaria. <br> I graduated
    primary school <strong>"Neofit Rilski" located in my hometown Kostandovo, Bulgaria</strong> where I graduated with
    <strong>Excellent 6.00 / 6.00</strong>. The second school where I studied and gruaduated my secondary education is
    <strong>National Vocational School of Forestry "Hristo Botev" located in Velingrad, Pazardzhik, Bulgaria</strong>
    with <strong>Very Good 4.62/6.00</strong>. Since I graduated I've focused all my energy on my development as a
    programmer, as my knowledge is still fleeting, but it doesn't demotivate me, on the contrary, it makes me even more
    ambitious and I actually think that things are going pretty smooth. <br> Below I have briefly presented myself and
    my intensions and goals for the future.
    <ul>
        <li>I see myself as a confident, constant, serious, dedicated, motivated and hard studying young person who has
            a desire to develop his skills and himself as a person in the field of programming. </li>
        <li>I read books and study every single day, with the aim of developing my modest(currently!) skills in the
            field.</li>
        <li>I'd say that the best quality I have discovered in myself since I began to enter and get to know this
            environment is that with everything I learn, my desire and interest in the material becomes even stronger.
        </li>
        <li>In my free time, after finishing my studies and readings for the day, I emphasize my physical activity,
            trying to train everyday without missing out, believing that good physical condition and daily going out of
            my body's comfort zone supports mental activity and helps me build discipline and character. I also try to
            run <em>at least</em> 5 kilometers, several times a week, because it helps me to relieve the stress and
            compensate for the long hours spent sitting in fron of the computer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Books</h2>
    I love reading books. Books are an unearthly treasure and what most people don't understand is that books are a
    great investment in ourselves. They help us to grow as individuals and to have our own view about the things that
    surround us. Books helps me stretch my mind, helps me think better and it gives me different points of view. These
    titles below are some of the books that taught me a lot and changed my life and control of my subconscious for the
    better.
    <ul>
        <li>'<strong><em>Mind Power Into the 21st Century</em></strong>' by <em>John Kehoe</em></li>
        <li>'<strong><em>Think and Grow Rich</em></strong>' by <em>Napoleon Hill</em></li>
        <li>'<strong><em>The four agreements</em></strong>' by <em>Don Miguel Ruiz</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>As a person who tries to develop himself every day, I know that the hobbies we have should also be well selected
        and help us with our development in themselves. I keep my list of hobbies small so that I can devote small but
        carefully focused time and attention to each of them daily.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Coding</li>
        <p>I know that the brain, just like the any muscle in the body, gets stronger when we make it work harder and
            use it every day. <em>Reading</em> and <em>coding</em> are first in my list because they are the things that
            I feel develop the most algorithmic and logical thinking in me.</p>
        <li>Daily workout</li>
        <p>Character growth lies, in part, in pushing your body out of its comfort zone every day by exercising and
            taking care of it. The best compliment we can give our body is to demand more of it. I believe that good
            physical condition enhances the thought process. Strong spirit in a strong body.</p>
